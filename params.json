See LICENSE.txt for more details\r\n\r\n## What is it about?\r\nAnimated signal icon implements the concept of icon stacking, where it's possible to change more than one color in an icon. In addition, it can be animated by using javascript.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nTo get these icons up and running it's firstly necessary to download them from Github. When it's done, there are only two steps remaining:\r\n\r\n1- CSS: Add the font-styles.css into your project with the fonts folder. A single icon is defined by using CSS as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.icon-simepar-signal-lvl-6:before {\r\n\tcontent: \"\\e60a\";\r\n}\r\n.icon-simepar-signal-lvl-6:after {\r\n\tcontent: \"\\e605\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2- HTML: Using the span tag you can add the icons' classes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"icon-simepar-signal-lvl-6\"></span>\r\n```\r\n![Alt text](signal-icon.jpg)\r\n\r\nNotice that the icon names differ only by a number, from 1 to 0, representing the amount of bars in the signal. The lvl-0 is supposed to be used as background. Doing the above steps, a static icon will be created, to make it animated it's still remaining:\r\n\r\n1- Give an ID to the span:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<span class=\"icon-simepar-signal-lvl-6 front\" id=\"signal-current-lvl\"></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2- In the javascript code, get its id and then change the class where it's needed:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar signal_icon = document.getElementById('signal-current-lvl'),\r\n  desired_level = 7;\r\nsignal_icon.className = 'icon-aev-signal-lvl-' + desired_level + ' front';\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the icons are fonts, it's possible to change their color, size and so on through the CSS code. Since the background and the front layer are separated fonts, it's also possible to have different colors on them.\r\n\r\n## How it was made?\r\nInkscape (https://inkscape.org) was used to draw the icons, the app icoMoon to convert them from svg into fonts (https://icomoon.io/) and some styles from http://css-tricks.com/stackicons-icon-fonts/ were added.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
